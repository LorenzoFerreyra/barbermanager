What to do:

1. Backend:

Important:
  - add change email functionality in PATCH /profile endpoint, that automatically sends email verification
  - add date based statistics for graph display

Proposed:
  - add return json object after creation or update for anything  https://openwebui.aspire.local/c/9d5f8f49-9f18-4937-ba9e-c7839bfb9b70

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Frontend:

Important:  
  
  - implement all admin pages and endpoints from api

    - make settings page, to edit profile values, like name, profile image, etc...

    - add availability page to edit it for selected barber (admins only)
    - add actions for editing barber availability (opens either page or popup)
    - add view barber profile on clicking barber (idk if i should add this)

  - do the same for barber, client, public pages/endpoints

  - remove availabilities from barber dashboard and put them on their own page
  - remove reviews page from barbers sidebar

  - important functionality for:
    - admin: profile, availabilities
    - barber: profile, services 
    - client: profile, appointment, reviews 

Proposed:

  - fix table text overflow when screen width is small
  - add error message when loading tables if the api request fails
  - on backend return availabilities, appointments sorted based on date (newer to older)
  
  - add delete appointment functionality for admins and barbers?
  
  - add responsivity to sidebar, show toggle button on header, width 100% for (small screens)
  - add media queries for screen sizes on each layout component 
   
  - add skeleton loading for page components

  - cleanup Form code, make it work automagically (Form.Button, auto fields, Form.Input, etc)
    
  - see if it's worth it to fix loading spinner not showing when accessing dashboard from a route 
    this happens because to redirect you need to be authenticated to get role
  
  - see how vite tests work and maybe implement some

  - check this logical thing, if we delete a barber that has associated appointments, do they stay or get deleted? This may impact total revenue accuracy, etc..
    same with barber services, if an appointment uses deleted services what happens? does the appointment get deleted?
  
  - change structure of project:
    - you can register as barbershop owner, then invite your own barbers
    - or you can register as client and view barbershops
    - admim can view evrything about the platform
