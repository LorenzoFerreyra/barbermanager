What to do:

1. Backend:

Important:
  - add change email functionality in PATCH /profile endpoint, that automatically sends email verification
  - add date based statistics for graph display

Proposed:
  - add return json object after creation or update for anything  https://openwebui.aspire.local/c/9d5f8f49-9f18-4937-ba9e-c7839bfb9b70

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Frontend:

Important:  

  - misc:
    - stylize barbers dropdown list, services checkbox and dateslot dropdown list with better data
    
  - admins:
    - add date_joined to barbers and clients pagination pages
        
  - clients:
    - add recent appointments (like reviews) in api profile
    
    - add client api endpoint that returns all barbers that the client has a completed appointment with (to be used for making reviews)

    - make client reviews page, where they can create, edit, delete reviews (to barbers which they have completed appointments with)
      - workflow: select create review action, opens popup with barbers which you have completed appointtments with, select one and write review,
        readapt client appointments page steps based moodal for this

  - public:
    - don't show booked slots for barber availabilities

  - fix trash and warning icons in the buttons not getting white when hovered in profile settings (works in dev not in prod)
  - return availabilities from API in date sorted order, (not text based as it is rn) 

Proposed:

  - add view barber profile on clicking barber (idk if i should add this)

  - enhance popup (or modal at this point) to stop it from being closed while loading

  - when creating appointment check if selected avaiability is not past

  - fix table text overflow when screen width is small
  - add error message when loading tables if the api request fails
  - on backend return availabilities, appointments sorted based on date (newer to older)
  
  - add delete appointment functionality for admins and barbers?
  
  - add responsivity to sidebar, show toggle button on header, width 100% for (small screens)
  - add media queries for screen sizes on each layout component 
  - fix settings page responsivity, input fields get of the card, on small screens
  
  - add loading prop to StatCard like Pagination (use it in dashboard instead of external if isLoading <Spinner/>)
  - add skeleton loading for page components

  - cleanup Form code, make it work automagically (Form.Button, auto fields, Form.Input, etc)
    
  - see if it's worth it to fix loading spinner not showing when accessing dashboard from a route 
    this happens because to redirect you need to be authenticated to get role
  
  - see how vite tests work and maybe implement some

  - change structure of project:
    - you can register as barbershop owner, then invite your own barbers
    - or you can register as client and view barbershops
    - admim can view evrything about the platform
    - services are like tags, barbers can add them to their own list, but not create new ones (although this is a pricing problem as it has to be the same for everyone)
