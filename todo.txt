What to do:

1. Backend:

Important:
  - add change email functionality in PATCH /profile endpoint, that automatically sends email verification
  - add date based statistics for graph display

Proposed:
  - add return json object after creation or update for anything  https://openwebui.aspire.local/c/9d5f8f49-9f18-4937-ba9e-c7839bfb9b70

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Frontend:

Important:  

  - all roles:
    - finish settings page by adding update profile popup (do it for barber for now, then adapt to client and admin)
      - don't forget to change data to the fields in the handler function, for consistency, look at update services
    
  - admins:
    - add create mutliple avaiabiities api endpoint (takes in start date, end date, start slot, end slot, 30 min interval each)
    
    - add manage availability functionality to admin barbers (create, update, delete)
      - workflow: select create availability, then enter either 1 date or interal (form takes account of whether using singuar creation api or multiple)
    
    - add availability page to edit it for selected barber 

  - clients:
    - add recent appointments (like reviews) in api profile
    - make clients appointments page, where they can view, create and cancel appointments
    
    - make client reviews page, where thtey can create, edit, delete reviews (to barbers which they have completed appointments with)
      - workflow: select create review action, opens popup with barbers which you have completed appointtments with, select one and write review

  - public:
    - add view barber profile on clicking barber (idk if i should add this)

Proposed:

  - enhance popup to stop it from being closed while loading
  
  - fix table text overflow when screen width is small
  - add error message when loading tables if the api request fails
  - on backend return availabilities, appointments sorted based on date (newer to older)
  
  - add delete appointment functionality for admins and barbers?
  
  - add responsivity to sidebar, show toggle button on header, width 100% for (small screens)
  - add media queries for screen sizes on each layout component 
   
  - add skeleton loading for page components

  - cleanup Form code, make it work automagically (Form.Button, auto fields, Form.Input, etc)
    
  - see if it's worth it to fix loading spinner not showing when accessing dashboard from a route 
    this happens because to redirect you need to be authenticated to get role
  
  - see how vite tests work and maybe implement some


  
  - change structure of project:
    - you can register as barbershop owner, then invite your own barbers
    - or you can register as client and view barbershops
    - admim can view evrything about the platform
    - services are like tags, barbers can add them to their own list, but not create new ones (although this is a pricing problem as it has to be the same for everyone)
