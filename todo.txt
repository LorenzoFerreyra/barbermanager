What to do:

1. Backend:

Important:
  - add change email functionality in PATCH /profile endpoint, that automatically sends email verification
  - add date based statistics for graph display

Proposed:
  - add return json object after creation or update for anything  https://openwebui.aspire.local/c/9d5f8f49-9f18-4937-ba9e-c7839bfb9b70

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Frontend:

Important:  
  
  - implement all admin pages and endpoints from api
  
    - add above action to invite a new barber

    - add actions for editing barber availability (opens either page or popup)
    - add view barber profile on clicking barber 

    - add appointment page (use tag for status in pagination table)
    - add availability page to edit it for selected barber (admins only)

  - do the same for barber pages/endpoints
  - do the same for client pages/endpoints
  - do the same for public pages/endpoints

Proposed:
  - on backend return availabilities, appointments sorted based on date (newer to older)
  
  - fix Pagination table not responsive, it's height doesn't change
  - add responsivity to sidebar, show toggle button on header, width 100% for (small screens)

  - change structure of project:
    - you can register as barbershop owner, then invite your own barbers
    - or you can register as client and view barbershops
    - admim can view evrything about the platform
    
  - add media queries for screen sizes on each layout component 
    make mobile sidebar button on header

  - add skeleton loading for page components
  
  - see if it's worth it to fix loading spinner not showing when accessing dashboard from a route 
    this happens because to redirect you need to be authenticated to get role
  
  - cleanup Form code, make it work automagically (Form.Button, auto fields, Form.Input, etc)
  - see how vite tests work and maybe implement some
